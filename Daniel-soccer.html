<h2 style="color: whitesmoke; font-family: cursive;">The sport of soccer (called football in most of the world) is considered to be the world's most popular sport. In soccer there are two teams of eleven players. Soccer is played on a large grass field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to get the soccer ball into the opposing team's goal. The key to soccer is that, with the exception of the goalie, players cannot touch the ball with their hands or arms, they can only kick, knee, chest, or head the ball to advance it or score a goal."</h2>

<h2 style="color: whitesmoke; font-family: cursive;">Soccer is played at all levels throughout the world from youth leagues to professional and international teams. Perhaps the most famous soccer tournament is the World Cup. Held every four years, the World Cup is a soccer competition between countries and is one of the most watched events in the world. One of the reasons soccer is so popular is that it really only takes a ball and a flat open area to play. Kids throughout the world will set up fields and goals just about anywhere and start playing the game. The game is also fun and competitive. Soccer is a great form of exercise as there is lots of running for good distances. The sport is also a good test of dexterity and a great way to learn balance.</h2>
