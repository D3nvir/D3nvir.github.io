<h2>What is Cricket?</h2>
<h2>Cricket is a bat and ball game played between two teams, 11 players each, on a field which has a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch in the centre. The game is played by 120 million players world-wide making it the second most popular sport in the world. The purpose of the game is to score more runs than your opposing team. A Cricket match is divided into periods called innings. It is decided before the game begins, if both teams will have one or two innings. During the innings one team bats while the other fields. All 11 players on the fielding team are on the pitch at the same time however only two batsmen are the field at any one time. Team captains toss a coin to decide who should bat first. Cricket fields tend to be oval in shape.  The end which is marked off is called the boundary, with the rectangle “pitch” in the centre. At each end of the pitch are the wickets, 22 yards apart.  A bowling crease is in line with the wicket and the batting or popping crease is 4ft in front of the wicket.</h2>

<h2>Types of bowls</h2>
<h2>Some examples of types of bowls are; Yorker, if the ball lands on the pitch, exactly on the crease, or full toss, when the ball crosses the crease without bouncing. The batsman tries to prevent the ball hitting the wickets with his bat. If the batsman strikes the ball and it is not caught without bouncing, then the batman tries to score runs for their team. Both batsmen run the length of the pitch, exchanging positions. This is worth one run to the sticking batsman. A batsman is run out when the batsman is outside the wicket he owns, outside his crease when the fielding team remove stump/s. If the batsman clears the boundary without the ball bouncing he scores 6 runs, if the ball bounces then crosses the boundary he scores 4 runs. A batsman can retire not out; this is normally after large amount of runs have been obtained. A dismissed batsman is replaced by another batsman until 10 out of the 11 batsman are out. When a set number of overs have been delivered or a team declares.</h2>
